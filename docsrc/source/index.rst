dish - A Lightweight **DI**\ rac **S**\ olver for **H**\ ydrogen-like Systems

What is dish?
-------------
    | *dish* is a Python package which allows the simple calculation of wavefunctions and energy levels for Hydrogen-like systems. The calculation is done by default in a relativistic context by solving the Dirac equation for a single electron in a spherical symmetric potential.
    | A subpackage also allows to retrieve the non-relativistic wavefunctions and energy-levels by solving the Schr√∂dinger equation.


Getting Started
---------------

To set your system up to work with *dish* see :doc:`setup`.

For a short introduction covering the most basic features see :doc:`quickstart`.

For further information see the :doc:`introduction` or read the :doc:`api` documentation.
